They are inspired by the organization of the visual cortex in animals, which has separate layers of cells that respond to different features such as edges, shapes, and textures.\n",

During convolution, a small matrix called a kernel or filter is moved across the input image, computing the dot product between the filter and the portion of the input image it is currently covering. This produces a feature map that highlights different features in the input image, such as edges or textures.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Pooling layers: These layers reduce the size of the feature maps by down-sampling them. The most common pooling operation is max pooling, which takes the maximum value in each portion of the feature map and discards the rest. This helps to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and extract only the most important features.\n",
